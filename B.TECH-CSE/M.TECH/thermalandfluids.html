                                        <p>Microfluidics is the research discipline dealing with transport phenomena and fluid-based devices at microscopic length scales of microns. This course aims to fulfil the need of basic understanding about fluid flow at microscale. Further, it introduces the students with electrostatics and its utility towards design of new microfluidic systems such as electroosmotic pump and Knudsen pump. In the later part, distinct types of microfabrication techniques are explained. The last chapter introduces many modern techniques related to biomedical engineering and medical science such as DNA sequencing, micropumps and point of care diagnostic devices.<br>Prerequisite: NIL</p>
