Their definitions are presented, and visualization/analysis techniques are discussed and empirical facts are presented. The empirical relation between the flow variables are discussed. Shockwave analysis and a review of macroscopic traffic flow models are presented. Traffic flow stability issues are discussed as well as numerical solution approaches.<br>The lectures also show how macroscopic models are derived from microscopic principles. This course provides an overview of human factors relevant for the behavior of drivers. The car-following model and other approaches to describe the lateral driving task will be discussed. The lectures also pertain to general gap acceptance modeling and lane changing.</p>

                                        <p>This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the analytical methods and tools used in the analysis of infrastructure (transportation) systems. The course focuses on the application of these techniques to real-world transportation systems and includes a mix of theoretical and practical content.<br>Students will learn about various analytical techniques including but not limited to traffic flow theory, network analysis, demand forecasting, and system optimization. The course will cover both traditional methods such as regression analysis and newer techniques such as machine learning and data analytics. The course will also delve into the use of software tools for transportation analysis and modeling. Students will get hands-on experience with these tools through assignments and projects.</p>

The course focuses on the application of these techniques to real-world transportation systems and includes a mix of theoretical and practical content. Students will learn about various analytical techniques including but not limited to traffic flow theory, network analysis, demand forecasting, and system optimization. The course will cover both traditional methods such as regression analysis and newer techniques such as machine learning and data analytics. The course will also delve into the use of software tools for transportation analysis and modeling. Students will get hands-on experience with these tools through assignments and projects.</p>
