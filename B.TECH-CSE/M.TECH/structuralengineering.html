This course provides the students an exposure for earthquake resistant designing of structures which are not usually covered in undergraduate design courses. Structural Dynamics or any equivalent course is the prerequisite for this course. Practical part of the course will provide in-depth understanding of dynamics of SDOF and MDOF, seismic response of building structures, and use of different type of sensor and equipment for dynamic response measurements, data processing and analysis.</p>
