The Shell Scripting component covers the fundamentals of scripting in Unix-like environments, including file manipulation, process control, and automation of repetitive tasks. The Android Programming section introduces students to the Android development environment, covering topics such as user interface design, event handling, data storage, and network communication. Through a series of hands-on lab exercises and projects, students will develop the skills necessary to write efficient shell scripts and build user-friendly Android applications.</p>

The primarily focus of this course is to provide detailed information about the state-of-the-art blockchain platforms and their supported smart contract languages. In particular, syntax, semantics, and paradigms of various smart contract languages will be discussed. In this perspective, blockchain-oriented software development life cycle and decentralized application development will be discussed. Following this, the course will cover two important directions: addressing various research challenges in blockchain and AI/machine learning for blockchain (and vice-versa).</p>

                                        <p>Formal methods are mathematically rigorous techniques to facilitate in building high-confidence critical systems with stringent quality requirements, such as safety and security. It provides a systematic guidance for specification, development, and verification of software and hardware systems. Examples for such systems are banking software, avionics software, medical device software, software used to control industrial plants/cars, etc. This course will provide necessary background on formal methods and their role in software engineering practice. A range of formal methods will be introduced along with practical case studies of their use. Students will learn how these methods can be used to build reliable software, hardware, and security protocols.</p>

In order to demonstrate how to analyze and verify a software system, this course will discuss the following three formal approaches using suitable examples: (a) Abstract Interpretation Theory, (b) Temporal Logic and Model Checking, and (c) Deductive Reasoning. In this context, formalism of syntax and semantics of programming languages will be explained considering a simple imperative language WHILE. All these approaches will be illustrated using real-life examples, such as microwave oven, mutual exclusion problem, etc.</p>

                                        <p>Several real world systems can be represented as a network of entities that are connected to each other through some relations. Often the number of entities is immensely large, thus forming a very large network. Typical examples of such large networks include network of entities in knowledge graphs, co-occurrence graph of the keywords in natural languages, interaction graph of users in social networks, protein-protein interaction graphs and the network of routers in Internet to name a few. Study of these networks is often needed for relational learning tasks, as well as for developing frameworks for representing the intrinsic structure of the data. This course will mainly deal with both the traditional as well as current state of the art machine learning techniques to be applied on Graphs for different downstream tasks.</p>

This application, however, is reliant on the unstated assumptions of availability and anonymity. The management and media access protocols of 802.11 may be particularly vulnerable to malicious denial-of-service (DoS) and various security attacks. This course analyzes these 802.11-specific attacks, including their applicability, effectiveness, and proposed low-cost implementation improvements to mitigate the underlying vulnerabilities.</p>
