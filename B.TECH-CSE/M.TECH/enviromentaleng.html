The course focuses on the application of these techniques to real-world transportation systems and includes a mix of theoretical and practical content. Students will learn about various analytical techniques including but not limited to traffic flow theory, network analysis, demand forecasting, and system optimization. The course will cover both traditional methods such as regression analysis and newer techniques such as machine learning and data analytics. The course will also delve into the use of software tools for transportation analysis and modeling. Students will get hands-on experience with these tools through assignments and projects.</p>
